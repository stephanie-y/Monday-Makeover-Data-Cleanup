# Monday-Makeover-Data-Cleanup
A series of data clean ups for Tableau use

2019 - Week 48
The original table is from NYC Open Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw

Some tweaks to the data were made in order to make it easier for use in Tableau.
The biggest things done were the following:
1) Format of the data was changed from a string to an date format.
2) Some unnecessary columns were removed.
